# simple-py-sql
A Simple Project for beginners in python, Managing(Create,Read and Update) Employees Details. For this project I'm using MySQL for storing the database.

## For Educational Purpose only

Here, we will be creating three different python applications to:
1. Read and Display Employee Details from Database
2. Add New Employee, taking input from user
3. Updating Employee Details, taking input Employee Id

## Database Table
DATABASE NAME: company
EMPLOYEE TABLE:
Employee(emp_id,name,designation,qualification,dob,address,gender)

- I'm using phpMyAdmin to create the database, you can use any other MySQL Administrator tool or command line.
